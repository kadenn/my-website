    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Kagan, I’m a full stack web developer with over 3 years of
      experience. I enjoy developing full stack web applications using the
      latest technologies to translate business requirements/logic into code.
      The things that I currently have the most experience working with are:
      Golang Python Docker JavaScript VueJS I was always interested in computers
      since I was a kid. My interest in programming started when I created my
      own Minecraft server to play with my friends. As I grew up, I continued to
      learn new things. I studied computer engineering in college to turn my
      passion into a career. I am able to learn and implement new concepts/tools
      quickly and easily. I know that learning and memorizing are not the same
      thing. I always train my mind to think instead of memorizing things.
